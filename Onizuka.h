// partial localizations that may default back to a more general localization
// (e.g., an en_GB file that only contains a few British vs American spelling
// differences), and/or you will do most localization once at program launch
// and thereafter do little or no on-the-fly localization, call this method to
// possibly improve the memory footprint of your application.

// Used for menu items like "About MyApp".
// Uses the value of CFBundleName from Info.plist (which is localizable).

// setAttributedStringValue:, setLabel:, setToolTip:, and setPaletteLabel:,
// using any and all of these (and their associated getters) if the object
// responds to the selector.
// If title is nil, uses existing label, title, or value, presumably set up
// in Interface Builder.
// Generally this is used internally when you call one of the three high-level
// methods above. You would typically use a non-nil title when changing an item
// in response to some change in application  state, for example:
//   [[Onizuka sharedOnizuka] localizeObject:myTextField
//                            withTitle:@"__NETWORK_ERROR__"];
// But, for some objects you would end up setting its string value,
// tool tip, and everything to the value you pass in.
// For really fine control, you may have to use even lower level
// techniques, like copyLocalizedTitle: below.

// string, that's what you get back. Otherwise you get back a string.

// with localized substrings, if they could be found.
