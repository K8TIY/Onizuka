// Low-level nonrecursive method that localizes via setTitle:, setStringValue:,
// setLabel:, setToolTip:, and setPaletteLabel:, using any and all of these
// (and their associated getters) if the object responds to the selector.
// If title is nil, uses existing label, title, or value, presumably set up
// in Interface Builder.
// Generally this is used internally when you call one of the three high-level
// methods above. You would typically use a non-nil title when changing an item
// in response to some change in application  state, for example:
//   [[Onizuka sharedOnizuka] localizeObject:myTextField
//                            withTitle:@"__NETWORK_ERROR__"];
// But, for some objects you would end up setting its string value,
// tool tip, and everything to the value you pass in.
// For really fine control, you may have to use even lower level
// techniques, like copyLocalizedTitle: below.
